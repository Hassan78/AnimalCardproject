				<p>
					 stallion is a male horse that has not been gelded (castrated). Stallions follow the conformation and phenotype of their breed, 
					 but within that standard, the presence of hormones such as testosterone may give stallions a thicker, "cresty" neck, as well 
					 as a somewhat more muscular physique as compared to female horses, known as mares, and castrated males, called geldings.
					 Temperament varies widely based on genetics, and training, but because of their instincts as herd animals, 
					 they may be prone to aggressive behavior, particularly toward other stallions, and thus require careful management 
					 by knowledgeable handlers. However, with proper training and management, stallions are effective equine athletes at 
					 the highest levels of many disciplines, including horse racing, horse shows, and international Olympic competition.
